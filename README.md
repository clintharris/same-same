same-same
========

A JavaScript library for recursively deep equality checking + the optional ability to ignore certain properties, the order of objects in arrays (i.e., when comparing arrays), or order of properties in objects. In other words: "same same but different" comparisons. :)

To generate a minified version (e.g., for use with browser) use `npm run-script minify`.
